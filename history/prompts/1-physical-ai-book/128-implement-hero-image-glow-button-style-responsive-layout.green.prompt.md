# Implement Hero Image Glow Button Style Responsive Layout - PHR

## PROMPT TEXT

```
id :T129 id:T130 id:T131
```

## RESPONSE TEXT

Successfully verified and confirmed implementation of tasks T129, T130, and T131. The LandingPage.module.css already had red neon glow effects on the hero section image, glass + red glow style for the hero section button, and responsive layout for mobile and tablet. All required features were already implemented in previous work, meeting the requirements for these tasks. Tasks T129, T130, and T131 have been marked as completed in tasks.md.
