# Introduction to Foundations

Welcome to the Foundations module of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This module establishes the essential concepts, tools, and principles that will support your journey through the more advanced topics in this book.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and its relationship to humanoid robotics
- Identify the key components of a humanoid robot system
- Understand the ethical considerations and safety protocols in robotics
- Set up your development environment with the required tools
- Recognize the different tiers of hardware requirements for this course

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI interacts with and operates within the physical world through robots, sensors, and actuators. This creates unique challenges and opportunities:

- **Real-time constraints**: Physical systems require immediate responses to environmental changes
- **Uncertainty handling**: Sensors provide noisy data that must be processed reliably
- **Embodiment**: The physical form of a robot affects its capabilities and limitations
- **Safety criticality**: Physical systems can cause harm if they malfunction

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are designed with human-like characteristics, typically featuring:
- Bipedal locomotion
- Human-like manipulation capabilities
- Social interaction features
- Anthropomorphic form factor

These robots are particularly interesting because they can operate in human-designed environments and potentially interact with humans in more intuitive ways.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:
1. Hardware Requirements - Understanding the computational needs
2. Software Prerequisites - Setting up the development environment
3. Basic Robotics Concepts - Core principles of robotics
4. Safety and Ethics - Responsible robotics practices
5. Exercises - Practical applications to reinforce learning

Let's begin by examining the hardware requirements for this course.
