# Capstone Project Assessment

## Overview

The Capstone Project Assessment evaluates your ability to integrate concepts from multiple modules of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This assessment requires you to demonstrate mastery of:

- ROS 2 node development and communication
- Digital twin simulation using Gazebo/Unity/Isaac Sim
- AI robot brain with perception capabilities
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline integration

## Learning Objectives

After completing this assessment, you should be able to:

1. Design and implement a humanoid robot control system that integrates multiple ROS 2 nodes
2. Configure and run simulation environments for humanoid robot testing
3. Implement perception pipelines with vision-language-action capabilities
4. Integrate voice commands with robot motion planning and navigation
5. Evaluate robot behavior using established metrics and validation procedures
